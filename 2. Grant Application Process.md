# Grant Application Process

*This document is purposefully split from the main Operating Manual to make it easier for prospective projects to find information on how to apply.*

Grants from the gZIL Collective are awarded in Seasons. Each Season has a defined "mission" — a core theme that grant applications must aim to fulfill. You can find more information about the status of the current Season [here](https://www.github.com/gzilcollective) or on the gZIL Collective's socials.

The grant application process consists of the following 4 stages:

### 1. Application Submission

**The application form for grant applications can be found [here](https://github.com/gzilcollective/Framework/blob/main/3.%20Application%20Form%20and%20Token%20Sheet.md).** 

The application submission window is open for a minimum of 4 weeks following the successful conclusion of the Mission Setting Process, as outlined in the Operating Manual. 

Applicants should submit their applications to the GZIL Collective Committee. Applications will be reviewed by the Committee to ensure basic feasibility, mission alignment, and readiness of the applicant. This review will be performed objectively using the rubric criteria set out in the Rubric Evaluation Form (as agreed by the GZIL community). This is to ensure that only applications that meet the minimum level of quality and detail are submitted to the governance forum. See the Committee Rubric Evaluation section for more information.

**Please email your completed application to gzilcollective@zilliqa.com with the subject line "Grant Application - [Team Name]"**

*e.g. Subject: Grant Application - World Liberty Financial* 

Applications will be assessed by the committee on a first come, first served basis.

### 2. Governance Forum Temperature Check
Applicants that pass the Rubric Evaluation will be notified by the Committee that they can progress to the Governance Forum. 

Applicants should post their application in full, as originally submitted to the committee, for the community to review and provide feedback. Teams are strongly encouraged to engage with the community during this phase and answer any questions posted in response to their application proposal. 

To pass the community temperature check **application proposals must achieve over 50% “For” votes after 5 days** and within 1 week of the application submission window closing date.

    
### 3. Snapshot Vote

All applications that pass the Governance Forum temperature check will progress to Snapshot for voting by gZIL holders. 

In order to give all applicants an equal chance, the Snapshot proposal for each eligible application will be initiated by a member of the gZIL Collective Committee after all Governance Forum Temperature Check polls have concluded. 

Community voting on Snapshot will be open for a period of 2 weeks, giving gZIL holders the opportunity to vote For/Against each proposal.

In cases where there are more than 5 applications that pass the Governance Forum Temperature Check, the 5 projects with the most 'For' votes at the conclusion of the Snapshot voting period will be awarded grants.

    
### 4. Grant Award

Applications that pass the Snapshot vote will be contacted by the committee and awarded the grant amount agreed by the community in the Snapshot proposal. This will consist of 30% up front, with the remaining 70% delivered in tranches as milestones are completed, as described in the Operating Manual.

## Accountability

### Conflicts of Interest

All committee members are required to disclose all anticipated conflicts of interest when applying to serve on the committee and all actual conflicts of interest if engaged in a vote affected by the conflict. Where a conflict is known to be present, the member should recuse themselves or provide a written voting rationale to the other committee members if they believe that they can vote impartially.

### Foul-play - WIP

### Committee Member Removal - WIP


## Funding Priorities

The fund aims to support projects that cover various aspects of ecosystem development to drive user adoption and on-chain liquidity, from community engagement and promotions to scaling innovative use cases. 

These fall into the following categories:

- **Community Initiatives:** Encouraging community-driven projects, including educational programs, hackathons, and meetups, to expand the Zilliqa user base and drive user engagement.
- **Tokens & NFTs:** Support for projects that wish to build on Zilliqa, including but not limited to decentralised physical infrastructure (DePin), NFT marketplaces, providing decentralized financial services (DeFi), DeSci/SciFi, interfacing with AI or increasing on-chain liquidity.
- **Tools and Infrastructure:** Projects that aim to improve the ease-of-use for users and developers alike, such as wallets, explorers, or interoperability and integration with other platforms and blockchains.
- **Marketing and Awareness:** Fund campaigns that increase awareness and adoption of Zilliqa among potential developers, users and investors through targeted campaigns.

The Collective does not intend to fund core development activities, e.g. projects that contribute to the core protocol layer, such as enhancing the security, scalability, or core functionality of the Zilliqa blockchain.

## Types of Funding

This section outlines the financial incentives available to projects and teams focussed on developing Zilliqa's ecosystem. For all types of funding, the gZIL community will be empowered via decentralised governance: the community will be core to the decision-making process, ensuring that funding decisions align with the interests of Zilliqa stakeholders. 

### Grants

- Funding for early-stage projects, with a focus on open-source development and community benefit.
- Funds will be released in tranches based on the achievement of predefined milestones to ensure accountability and progress, with clear reporting requirements for funded projects to maintain transparency and allow for performance monitoring.
- The largest grants awarded will be up to $50k USD worth of ZIL

### Tips
- Typically smaller rewards, tips provide a mechanism to reward community members for work that has already been completed
- Rewarded once per quarter after all tip submissions have been reviewed by gZIL holders
- This system allows for a flexible and community-driven way to reward contributions that benefit the Zilliqa ecosystem. It's a great way to recognise and incentivise valuable work that might not fit into the traditional proposal or bounty models

## Token Project Distribution Terms - WIP

Projects funded by the gZIL Collective via a grant that intend to launch a token will be subject to the Collective's Token Project Distribution Terms. These terms set conditions on the grantee project's TGE to ensure a small proportion of the supply is distributed back to the Collective according to an agreed vesting schedule. 

This approach fosters alignment between grantee projects and the Zilliqa community by encouraging gZIL holders to actively support and champion projects throughout their test, launch, and growth phase, whilst at the same time motivating grantee projects to maintain long-term connections and contributions to the Zilliqa ecosystem beyond their initial launch.


## Treasury Management and Fund Utilisation

The gZIL Collective must strike a  balance between maximizing impact through the effective distribution of funds and ensuring the longevity of the treasury to sustain future initiatives. While investing in projects that drive meaningful ecosystem growth and community benefits is a priority, it is equally essential to preserve the fund's health for continued support of long-term opportunities and unforeseen challenges. This dual focus requires careful stewardship of resources, strategic allocation of funds, and a commitment to transparency and adaptability in financial decision-making. By aligning short-term impact with long-term sustainability, the gZIL Collective can foster a thriving, resilient ecosystem.

### Treasury Governance - WIP
To ensure responsible financial management while maintaining community involvement, the following structure is applied:

- **Community Decisions:** gZIL holders vote on the high-level treasury strategy, i.e. the percentage of funds allocated to investments, grants, and stablecoin conversion
- **Allocation Proposals:** The committee will submit allocation proposals on a quarterly basis, and invite the community to discuss, adjust and approve proposals via the governance and snapshot portals
- **Committee Decisions:** The gZIL Committee executes these strategies, determining the best financial instruments, risk mitigation strategies, and timing for stablecoin conversion and investments. This is to enable quicker reactions to risk scenarios, such as de-pegging events or poorly performing investments
- **Transparency Measures:** Quarterly reports on fund allocations and financial decisions will be published for community review

### Allocation Limits and Safeguards

To prevent centralisation of funds, minimise risk and ensure equitable distribution, the following limits will be imposed:

- No single project, individual, or entity may receive more than 10% of total available funds at any given time
- A minimum of 20% of funds must always be allocated towards ecosystem growth (i.e. grants, tips, developer incentives, and community initiatives)
- Treasury diversification thresholds will be established to ensure a balanced allocation between ZIL, stablecoins, and strategic investments
- The gZIL Committee and Zilliqa Core has veto power to prevent malicious or self-serving proposals, but vetoes can be overridden by a subsequent community vote with a 66% ‘For’ threshold 
- Each allocation 'bucket' can be adjusted by a maximum increment of ±20% compared to the previous quarter

### Example Allocation

A potential allocation strategy for the initial 125M ZIL treasury could be structured as follows:

- **25% (31.25M ZIL) – Ecosystem Grants & Development:** Funding for innovative projects, developer incentives, and ecosystem expansion
- **20% (25M ZIL) – Strategic Investments:** Investing in promising blockchain startups, liquidity pools, or other initiatives that benefit the Zilliqa network to generate revenue
- **25% (31.25M ZIL) – Stablecoin Conversion & Treasury Reserves:** Converting a portion of ZIL to stablecoins to mitigate market volatility and ensure sustainable long-term funding
- **5% (6.25M ZIL) – Operational Costs & Committee Budget:** Covering administrative costs, committee compensations, audits, and legal expenses
- **25% (31.25M ZIL) – ZQ2 Validator Node:** A non-delegated validator node on Zilliqa 2.0 to generate revenue

### gZIL Committee Validator Node on Zilliqa 2.0

#### Intent
The gZIL Committee proposes operating a dedicated, non-delegated validator node on Zilliqa 2.0 to grow the grant fund sustainably while supporting the network’s security and decentralization goals.

#### Rationale and Advantages
Zilliqa 2.0’s staking mechanics are designed to offer significantly higher initial APRs compared to its predecessor, with early participation likely to yield outsized returns during the network’s launch phase. By staking the fund assets (or a portion of) during this period, we aim to amplify the fund’s value over time. For example, a 20% average APR over a year could increase the grant pool proportionally, enabling larger or more frequent ecosystem investments.

Running a solo validator ensures full control over staked assets and rewards, eliminating reliance on third-party validators or delegators. This approach simplifies governance, reduces potential conflicts of interest or competition with existing node operators, and aligns with the broader principles of decentralization.

Zilliqa 2.0’s validator infrastructure is designed for efficiency, requiring minimal technical overhead. The Zilliqa Core Team will provide the necessary support to streamline the setup and maintenance process, ensuring smooth operations and enabling the committee to focus on strategic goals.

#### Implementation Considerations
Timing is key. With Zilliqa 2.0 tentatively scheduled to launch in late March 2024, we will prioritize staking during the initial high-APR phase to maximize returns. To manage rewards effectively, we will establish formal rules for their allocation. For instance:

- A set percentage of rewards will be reinvested into the grant fund to expand future ecosystem investments or reward active gZIL users.
- A portion will be reserved for operational costs, such as compensating Committee members and maintaining infrastructure.

By taking a proactive approach to staking and governance, we will not only grow the fund’s value but also reinforce the alignment of incentives between stakeholders and the Zilliqa ecosystem.

## Collective Grant Policies

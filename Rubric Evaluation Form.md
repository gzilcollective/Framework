# Rubric Evaluation Form

## Intent

Grant applications will initially be reviewed by the committee to ensure basic feasibility and mission alignment. This review will be performed objectively using the rubric set out in the Rubric Evaluation Form, using criteria agreed with the gZIL community. 

Due to the current low quorum and voter participation, and the relatively high value of the fund, there is a significant risk of sybil attack, so this step is solely to prevent malicious proposals from progressing to Snapshot in this early phase, and will ensure that only applications that meet the minimum level of quality and detail are submitted to the governance forum. 

Once voter participation and quorum increase sufficiently, the intention is to further decentralise this process.

## Criteria

For each criterion listed, applications will be evaluated based on a binary point system: either the maximum points or no points are awarded. Each criterion is assigned a weighted points value that reflects its relative importance in the overall assessment.

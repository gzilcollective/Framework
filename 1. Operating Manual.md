## Funding Priorities

The fund aims to support projects that cover various aspects of ecosystem development to drive user adoption and on-chain liquidity, from community engagement and promotions to scaling innovative use cases. 

These fall into the following categories:

- **Community Initiatives:** Encouraging community-driven projects, including educational programs, hackathons, and meetups, to expand the Zilliqa user base and drive user engagement.
- **Tokens & NFTs:** Support for projects that wish to build on Zilliqa, including but not limited to decentralised physical infrastructure (DePin), NFT marketplaces, providing decentralized financial services (DeFi), DeSci/SciFi, interfacing with AI or increasing on-chain liquidity.
- **Tools and Infrastructure:** Projects that aim to improve the ease-of-use for users and developers alike, such as wallets, explorers, or interoperability and integration with other platforms and blockchains.
- **Marketing and Awareness:** Fund campaigns that increase awareness and adoption of Zilliqa among potential developers, users and investors through targeted campaigns.

The Collective does not intend to fund core development activities, e.g. projects that contribute to the core protocol layer, such as enhancing the security, scalability, or core functionality of the Zilliqa blockchain.

## Types of Funding

This section outlines the financial incentives available to projects and teams focussed on developing Zilliqa's ecosystem. For all types of funding, the gZIL community will be empowered via decentralised governance: the community will be core to the decision-making process, ensuring that funding decisions align with the interests of Zilliqa stakeholders. 

### Grants

#### Overview

- Funding for early-stage projects, with a focus on open-source development and community benefit.
- Grants from the gZIL Collective are awarded in quarterly* Seasons. Each season has a defined "mission" — a core theme that grant applications must aim to fulfill.
- A maximum of 5 grants per season will be awarded to ensure funding is concentrated on the most impactful projects.
- Funds will be released in tranches based on the achievement of predefined milestones to ensure accountability and progress, with clear reporting requirements for funded projects to maintain transparency and allow for performance monitoring.
- The largest grants awarded will be up to $50k USD worth of ZIL

#### Grant Seasons & Mission Setting
To ensure funding remains strategically aligned with the evolving needs of the Zilliqa ecosystem, grants will be awarded in Seasons. Each season will have a defined "mission" — a core theme that grant applications must aim to fulfill — agreed upon by the gZIL Committee and the community. This approach ensures funding is directed towards high-impact priorities, while allowing the fund to scale sustainably over time.

##### *Season Cadence
- **First Year:** Grants will be awarded once every 6 months to allow the treasury to grow sufficiently through staking and treasury management returns.
- **After Year One:** Grants will shift to a quarterly cycle, with funding rounds opening at the end of each quarter.

##### Mission Setting Process

Before each grant season begins, the Committee and the community will collaborate to agree on a "mission" or theme for that funding round. The process is as follows:

**1. Community Input Phase (Week 1):**
- The Committee will initiate a community discussion thread on the governance forum inviting suggestions for the mission of the upcoming grant season
- Suggested missions could include: increasing Total Value Locked (TVL), expanding Zilliqa’s DeFi ecosystem, enhancing NFT utility, driving developer tooling, etc.

**2. Committee Curation Phase (Week 2):**
- The Committee will review, consolidate, and shortlist 3-5 mission themes from community suggestions.
- The shortlisted themes will be practical, high-impact, and aligned with Zilliqa’s broader ecosystem goals.

**3. Snapshot Vote (Week 3):**
- The community will vote on Snapshot to select the mission for the upcoming grant season.
- The winning mission will become the core funding theme for that season.

**4. Application Opening (Week 4):**
- The Committee will announce the chosen mission and open grant applications aligned to that theme.
- While applications may touch on other areas, those most aligned with the mission will be prioritized.

**5. Review & Impact Assessment (End of Season):**
- At the end of each season, the Committee will review the outcomes of funded projects and report on how effectively the mission was fulfilled.
- These insights will help shape the priorities of future funding rounds.

##### Why Mission-Based Funding Matters
- It allows the Collective to concentrate resources on a specific high-impact objective per season.
- It increases community involvement by allowing them to shape funding priorities.
- It creates measurable impact as funded projects can be evaluated against the season’s mission.
- It prevents fragmented or unfocused funding, ensuring maximum ROI for the Zilliqa ecosystem.

### Tips

#### Overview

- Typically smaller rewards, tips provide a mechanism to reward community members, teams or projects that have already delivered measurable value to the Zilliqa ecosystem without prior funding
- This process is intended to recognise and incentivise community-led contributions that significantly benefit the network, and that otherwise might not fit into the traditional grant funding model
- Rewarded once per quarter after all tip submissions have been reviewed by gZIL holders
- The Tips program operates on a retrospective basis — the work must already be complete, publicly available, and demonstrate clear impact before a Tip can be considered

#### Tip Seasons & Cadence
Tips will be awarded once per quarter (in sync with the Grant Seasons) to ensure a structured and predictable process. 

#### Tip Nomination Process
The Tip Nomination Process is entirely community-driven, allowing any community member to nominate individuals, teams, or projects they believe deserve retrospective rewards.

**1. Open Nominations (Week 1):**
- The Committee will open a Tip Nomination Period at the start of each quarter (aligned with the grant season).
- Any community member may submit a nomination to the Committee. The nomination must include:
  - Name of the project/person: Who is being nominated.
  - Description of work: A summary of the work that has been completed and its impact.
  - Links/Evidence: Supporting materials, such as GitHub repos, social media campaigns, product demos, or media coverage.
  - Suggested Tip Amount: An optional field where the nominator can suggest a Tip value (in ZIL).

  **Key Rule:** The work must be fully completed and publicly available. Incomplete work or pre-launched products are ineligible.

**2. Community Discussion & Validation (Week 2):**
- Once nominations close, all nominations will be published in a dedicated "Tip Nomination Thread" on the governance forum.
- The community is encouraged to discuss and validate the contributions by:
  - Supporting nominations they agree with.
  - Providing additional evidence or testimonials about the project's impact.
  - Raising any concerns about nominations they believe are undeserving.
- This period serves as social validation, ensuring that only genuinely impactful contributions receive Tips.
- The Committee will monitor the discussion but will not influence the validation phase to ensure neutrality.

**3. Committee Review & Shortlist (Week 3):**
- The Committee will formally review all nominations based on:
  1. Impact: Did the contribution meaningfully benefit the Zilliqa ecosystem?
  1. Originality: Was the work innovative, unique, or particularly valuable?
  1. Effort: Did the work require significant effort, resources, or expertise?
  1. Alignment: Does the work align with the Zilliqa Collective’s mission and priorities?
- The Committee will then shortlist the nominations and assign a proposed Tip amount for each.
- If the cumulative value of Tips exceeds the budget allocation for that quarter, the Committee may prioritize the highest-impact contributions.

**4. Community Voting on Tips (Week 4):**
- The shortlisted nominations, along with their proposed Tip amounts, will be put to a Snapshot vote.
- gZIL holders will vote For/Against each shortlisted Tip.
- Any Tip receiving over 66% ‘For’ votes will be awarded.
- If a Tip is rejected, the Committee may reconsider it in the next quarter if new evidence of impact emerges.

**5. Tip Disbursement (Week 5):**
- Approved Tips will be disbursed from the Treasury within 7 days of the Snapshot vote.
- Recipients will receive their Tip in ZIL (equivalent to the approved Tip amount).

#### Tip Size and Budget Allocation - WIP
 
| **Contribution Size**  | **Typical Tip Amount**   | **Examples**  |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| **Small Contribution**  | $500 - $2,000 in ZIL    | Creating an open-source tool, writing a detailed technical guide, translating key ecosystem documentation, running a social media awareness campaign. |
| **Medium Contribution** | $2,000 - $5,000 in ZIL  | Developing a smart contract template, building an analytics dashboard, organizing a small community event or workshop, creating an in-depth research report on Zilliqa adoption. |
| **Large Contribution**  | $5,000 - $10,000 in ZIL | Developing an MVP for a Zilliqa-based tool (e.g., token launcher, NFT minting tool), running a large-scale marketing campaign, producing a high-quality educational video series, hosting a hackathon or dev bootcamp. |


## Token Project Distribution Terms - WIP

Projects funded by the gZIL Collective via a grant that intend to launch a token will be subject to the Collective's Token Project Distribution Terms. These terms set conditions on the grantee project's TGE to ensure a small proportion of the supply is distributed back to the Collective according to an agreed vesting schedule. 

This approach fosters alignment between grantee projects and the Zilliqa community by encouraging gZIL holders to actively support and champion projects throughout their test, launch, and growth phase, whilst at the same time motivating grantee projects to maintain long-term connections and contributions to the Zilliqa ecosystem beyond their initial launch.


## Treasury Management and Fund Utilisation

The gZIL Collective must strike a  balance between maximizing impact through the effective distribution of funds and ensuring the longevity of the treasury to sustain future initiatives. While investing in projects that drive meaningful ecosystem growth and community benefits is a priority, it is equally essential to preserve the fund's health for continued support of long-term opportunities and unforeseen challenges. This dual focus requires careful stewardship of resources, strategic allocation of funds, and a commitment to transparency and adaptability in financial decision-making. By aligning short-term impact with long-term sustainability, the gZIL Collective can foster a thriving, resilient ecosystem.

### Treasury Governance - WIP
To ensure responsible financial management while maintaining community involvement, the following structure is applied:

- **Community Decisions:** gZIL holders vote on the high-level treasury strategy, i.e. the percentage of funds allocated to investments, grants, and stablecoin conversion
- **Allocation Proposals:** The committee will submit allocation proposals on a quarterly basis, and invite the community to discuss, adjust and approve proposals via the governance and snapshot portals
- **Committee Decisions:** The gZIL Committee executes these strategies, determining the best financial instruments, risk mitigation strategies, and timing for stablecoin conversion and investments. This is to enable quicker reactions to risk scenarios, such as de-pegging events or poorly performing investments
- **Transparency Measures:** Quarterly reports on fund allocations and financial decisions will be published for community review

### Allocation Limits and Safeguards - WIP

To prevent centralisation of funds, minimise risk and ensure equitable distribution, the following limits will be imposed:

- No single project, individual, or entity may receive more than 10% of total available funds at any given time
- A minimum of 20% of funds must always be allocated towards ecosystem growth (i.e. grants, tips, developer incentives, and community initiatives)
- Treasury diversification thresholds will be established to ensure a balanced allocation between ZIL, stablecoins, and strategic investments
- The gZIL Committee has veto power to prevent malicious or self-serving proposals
- Each allocation 'bucket' can be adjusted by a maximum increment of ±20% compared to the previous quarter

### Example Allocation

A potential allocation strategy for the initial 125M ZIL treasury could be structured as follows:

- **25% (31.25M ZIL) – Ecosystem Grants & Development:** Funding for innovative projects, developer incentives, and ecosystem expansion
- **20% (25M ZIL) – Strategic Investments:** Investing in promising blockchain startups, liquidity pools, or other initiatives that benefit the Zilliqa network to generate revenue
- **25% (31.25M ZIL) – Stablecoin Conversion & Treasury Reserves:** Converting a portion of ZIL to stablecoins to mitigate market volatility and ensure sustainable long-term funding
- **5% (6.25M ZIL) – Operational Costs & Committee Budget:** Covering administrative costs, committee compensations, audits, and legal expenses
- **25% (31.25M ZIL) – ZQ2 Validator Node:** A non-delegated validator node on Zilliqa 2.0 to generate revenue

### gZIL Committee Validator Node on Zilliqa 2.0

#### Intent
The gZIL Committee proposes operating a dedicated, non-delegated validator node on Zilliqa 2.0 to grow the grant fund sustainably while supporting the network’s security and decentralization goals.

#### Rationale and Advantages
Zilliqa 2.0’s staking mechanics are designed to offer significantly higher initial APRs compared to its predecessor, with early participation likely to yield outsized returns during the network’s launch phase. By staking the fund assets (or a portion of) during this period, we aim to amplify the fund’s value over time. For example, a 20% average APR over a year could increase the grant pool proportionally, enabling larger or more frequent ecosystem investments.

Running a solo validator ensures full control over staked assets and rewards, eliminating reliance on third-party validators or delegators. This approach simplifies governance, reduces potential conflicts of interest or competition with existing node operators, and aligns with the broader principles of decentralization.

Zilliqa 2.0’s validator infrastructure is designed for efficiency, requiring minimal technical overhead. The Zilliqa Core Team will provide the necessary support to streamline the setup and maintenance process, ensuring smooth operations and enabling the committee to focus on strategic goals.

#### Implementation Considerations
Timing is key. With Zilliqa 2.0 tentatively scheduled to launch in late Q1 or early Q2 2024, we will prioritize staking during the initial high-APR phase to maximize returns. To manage rewards effectively, we will establish formal rules for their allocation. For instance:

- A set percentage of rewards will be reinvested into the grant fund to expand future ecosystem investments or reward active gZIL users.
- A portion will be reserved for operational costs, such as compensating Committee members and maintaining infrastructure.

By taking a proactive approach to staking and governance, we will not only grow the fund’s value but also reinforce the alignment of incentives between stakeholders and the Zilliqa ecosystem.

## Collective Grant Policies

### Termination Conditions

The GZIL Committee may terminate grants and reclaim funds if recipients:

- **Fail to Meet Milestones**: After two warnings and a 30-day grace period
- **Misuse Funds**: Using grants for purposes outside the approved proposal
- **Violate Policies**: Breaching ethical standards, or disclosure requirements
- **Provide False Information**: Misrepresentation in proposals or progress reports
- **Engage in Illegal Activity**: Legal/regulatory violations or intellectual property theft

### Changes to Proposals

- **Minor Changes**: Require Committee approval (e.g., timeline adjustments)
- **Major Changes** (e.g., scope, budget, KPIs):
    - Must submit a revised proposal (to be added eventually : for community Snapshot vote)
    - Unapproved changes may result in termination

### Grant Disbursement & Vesting

- **Milestone-Based Funding**:
    - Grants are disbursed in tranches: 30% upfront, 70% upon milestone completion
    - Recipients must submit progress reports for each milestone to unlock subsequent payments

### Ongoing Grant Funding Eligibility

- Projects with **incomplete milestones** from prior grants are **ineligible for new funding**.
- Teams must complete all milestones from their current grant before reapplying
